      <p><em><strong>&ldquo;Cloud&rdquo;</strong></em> aka just plain(powerful too) servers. That&rsquo;s it, the secret behind this whole <strong>CLOUD</strong> black-box thing is that it&rsquo;s just a fancy name for a group of servers. Well practically it&rsquo;s not, but from a far-away non-technical point of view, yes, just a group of servers.</p>
<p>Let me give you a brief or somewhat a small detailed view of the whole Cloud world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So the story goes like this, before all this Cloud magic tech there were physical on-premise servers(own servers inside a warehouse or rented) which are assembled and configured and deployed by the companies. You know these as Website Hosting services. This was a little (whom am I kidding), a very huge headache task for the sysadmins to maintain all those hardware and software for the companies. Scalability and Availability was not even invented yet. Then came the virtualization technology which revolutionized the whole on-premise server problem which of scalability, but this was not good enough. Then People started to think how to tackle the problems and they knew virtualization was the key. They came up with the idea of combining the <strong>CPU, Memory, Storage</strong> resource from all the servers and make a pool of the resources and distribute it among the virtualized servers. That&rsquo;s it!!! Thus came the idea of Cloud. Then later network is also added into the resource pool.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So by definition Cloud is a group of servers whose Computational,Storage, and Networking resources are combined into a pool. Cloud Computing is the technology which uses this pool of resources to allocate virtual servers among different data centers across countries, heck continents. Cloud or more specifically Cloud Computing was the solution to the problem of on-premise servers. Cloud Computing not only combines the resources, it also helps the ops-team to easily spawn up virtual server through web GUI called Dashboard or if they want to automate the process they could just call the cloud APIs. It solved the Availability and Scalability problems by distribution of virtual servers across different data centers and have different copies of the servers on a virtual load balancer. Maintenance was also easy as the GUI helped the sysadmins to automate the failures notifications through APIs and they can have dashboards to know which hardware or software patch to replace or update.</p>
<p>As everything, Cloud too has some categories based on which different types of usages of the cloud can be shown.</p>
<p>Types of Cloud based on the Deployment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Private Cloud : Owned by the companies or organizations and whose services are not available to the public. Ex: Openstack</li>
<li>Public Cloud : Seriously, you couldn&rsquo;t guess the meaning&hellip; Come on&hellip; Ex: AWS, GCP, Azure</li>
<li>Hybrid Cloud : Combines the two Ex: IBM Cloud</li>
</ul>
<p>Types of Cloud based on Services:</p>
<ul>
<li>IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Base of the all the Cloud Service, deals with low level compute servers, networking, database, storage. Ex: AWS EC2</li>
<li>PaaS (Platform as a Service): Services which are maintained by the cloud providers Ex: Heroku</li>
<li>SaaS (Software as a Service): Whole Software are provided as a service for the users Ex: Google Drive</li>
</ul>
<p>OK enough of the school syllabus stuff, Now we can begin the cool stuff about Cloud.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Things need to know</p>
<ul>
<li>How actually a virtual server is created.</li>
<li>What are the basic (IaaS) services you have to learn for you know host your first website/webapp</li>
<li>Some Expert level game plays, tricks.</li>
<li>And yes a why you need to learn a little about the cloud.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Well bye for now.</p>
